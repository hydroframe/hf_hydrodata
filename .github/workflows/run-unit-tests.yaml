  # Run GitHub Actions when the main branch is modified.
  # This includes after code changes are merged to main from a PR.
  # Merging to main requires the Verde-based Jenkins jobs to pass.

  # If this remote GitHub Action fails, it means there is a discrepancy with the 
  # version of hf_hydrodata installed into the hydrogen-service API.
  # If this fails:
  #  - Trigger a manual re-build of the hydrogen-service Jenkins job to rebuild the API
  #  - Manually re-run the failing hf_hydrodata GitHub Actions job
