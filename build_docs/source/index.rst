Welcome to Hydrodata Documentation
=======================================

hf_hydrodata is an open-source project that serves a large number of different files types
important to hydrologic research. Some of these files have been accumulated from open-source data repositories,
while others have been derived by our team of scientists and software engineers.

:ref:`getting_started_index` contains installation instructions and a quick-start guide for obtaining 
gridded and point datasets. The secions on :ref:`gridded_data` and :ref:`point_data_index` provide more
detail on the datasets and fields that are avaialble. Full example workflows are in :ref:`examples_index`
and the :ref:`api` contains the full list of available functions.
