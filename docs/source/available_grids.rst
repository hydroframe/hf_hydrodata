Grids
===========
Gridded data are available on multiple grids. The projection, extent and resolution of every grid is summarized below. The most common grids used in the database are the 1km resolution CONUS1 and CONUS2 grids that are used for version 1 and version 2 of the National ParFlow model respectively. The figure below shows the extents of the CONUS1 and CONUS2 grids (for additional details refer to the `HydroFrame pages <https://hydrframe.org>`_ on each domain).  Some additional grids are available for specific datasets depending on how the data were received or processed.
