Available Datasets and Data Products
========================================
Data is accessed using attributes that can be used to filter and slice requested data.
The attributes of both point data and gridded data are organized by datasets.

A dataset is a collection of data variables collected
or generated together. Data can be identified by filtering by the dataset, variable, temporal_resolution as well
as other optional filters such as grid or aggregation to identify data. 

Data can also be sliced by space using python parameters: 'grid_bounds' or 'latlon_bounds'.
Data can be sliced by time using python parameters: 'start_time' and 'end_time'.
See examples in the QuickStart Guide section.
