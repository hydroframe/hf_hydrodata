Available Datasets and Data Products
========================================
The HydroData catalog contains a variety of datasets and data products to support national hydrologic modeling and analysis. We have the following categories of datasets:
   1. Point Observations: Point observations of hydrologic variables (e.g. streamflow and water table depth) that have been assembled and processed from a variety of external sources. 
   2. ParFlow Simulation Outputs: Gridded outputs from ParFlow simulations of the contiguous US. 
   3. Meteorological Forcings: Gridded datasets that contain meteorological forcing variables (e.g. precipitation, temperature, and wind speed) needed to drive hydrologic models.
   4. Static model inputs and domain files: Gridded datasets that contain static model inputs that are used directly in model definition (e.g. soil properties, land cover, and hydraulic conductivity) as well as additional domain files that are used in pre and post processing (e.g. distance to streams and watershed boundaries).
   5. Current Conditions: Current hydrologic conditions generated by the [HydroGEN project](https://hydro-generation.org)
   6. Remote sensing: Gridded observation products that are generated from remote sensing. 

Within each category you will find multiple datasets. Each dataset contains a collection of variables (refer to the variable table on each dataset page for more details).

Data can be identified by filtering by the dataset, variable, temporal_resolution as well
as other optional filters such as grid or aggregation to identify data. Examples of filtering and slicing datasets are provided in the `Working with Gridded Data` and `Working with Point Observations` sections. 

You can scroll through `available_datasets` section to see more details on all data that is available for use. Additionally, `available_variables`, `available_grids`, `available_temporal_resolutions`, and `available_aggregations` sections provide more information on the variables and attributes of the data catalog.
