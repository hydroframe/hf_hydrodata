Welcome to Hydrodata Documentation
=======================================

``hf_hydrodata`` is an open-source project that serves a large number of different files types
important to hydrologic research. Some of these files have been accumulated from open-source data repositories,
while others have been derived by our team of scientists and software engineers.

:ref:`getting_started` contains installation instructions and a quick-start guide for obtaining 
gridded datasets and point observations. The sections on :ref:`available_data`, :ref:`gridded_data_index` 
and :ref:`point_data_index` provide more detail on the datasets and fields that are available. 
Full example jupyter workbook workflows are in `Working with Point Observations` :ref:`examples_index` and the :ref:`api` contains the full list of available functions.
