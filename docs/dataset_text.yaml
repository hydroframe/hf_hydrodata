  "conus1_domain":
    summary: >
      The CONUS1 domain covers a large contiguous region in the US and areas draining to it.
      The domain extent and projection are based off of the National Water Model Grid. 
      Manual corrections were made along the coastline to get rid of cells that were water 
      and to prune any orphan cells (i.e. cells attached to the domain only by a corner).
